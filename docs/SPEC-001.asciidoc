= SPEC-001: BiteBase AI Assistant for Restaurant Market Insights
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

BiteBase AI Assistant is a web-based application designed to deliver real-time market insights for restaurant owners using data from local food delivery platforms (LINEMAN, GRAB FOOD, FOOD PANDA), social listening tools, and landing price statistics. The goal is to create a functional MVP within 2 weeks, focusing on data-driven decision-making for restaurant operations.

== Requirements

The MVP will focus on the following core features prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

*Must-Have (Critical for MVP)*
- Real-time data ingestion (daily batch updates).
- AI-driven insights (competitor analysis, customer behavior, demand forecasting).
- Natural language query support (NLP-based interaction).
- Interactive dashboard with key metrics and visualizations.
- User feedback mechanism for AI recommendation improvement.
- Model performance monitoring and alerting.
- Secure role-based access control (restaurant owners, franchise managers).

*Should-Have (Enhances Functionality)*
- Predictive analytics for trend forecasting.
- Basic event tracking for user behavior analysis.

*Could-Have (Optional Enhancements)*
- Voice-enabled AI interaction for future scalability.
- Advanced sentiment analysis from social data.

*Won't-Have (Out of Scope for Now)*
- Global data integration beyond APEC markets.
- Fully automated marketing campaign management.

== Method

The BiteBase AI Assistant will be designed as a modular, web-based architecture hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

=== Key Components

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - Interactive dashboard for data visualization.
   - AI Assistant Chat Interface for NLP queries.
   - User feedback module for continuous improvement.
   - User behavior tracking for analytics.

2. **Backend (Python - FastAPI)**
   - REST API with JWT-based authentication.
   - Data processing and validation layers.
   - API documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger).

3. **AI Engine**
   - NLP Query Handler (spaCy) for natural language processing.
   - Predictive Analytics (Prophet for forecasting, K-means for clustering).
   - Model Monitoring Module (Prometheus + Grafana).

4. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
   - Firestore for unstructured data (social listening).
   - Automated data ingestion pipelines with validation checks.

5. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Prometheus for model performance tracking.
   - Feedback loop integrated into the dashboard.
   - Event tracking with Google Analytics.

== Implementation

The implementation will be completed in 4 rapid sprints over 2 weeks.

=== Sprint 1 (Days 1-3): Project Setup & Infrastructure
- Setup GCP infrastructure (Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Firestore).
- Configure CI/CD pipelines and secure APIs (JWT).
- Deploy monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).

**Deliverables:**
- Cloud infrastructure operational with security protocols.

=== Sprint 2 (Days 4-6): Data Ingestion & Validation
- Develop data scrapers for LINEMAN, GRAB FOOD, FOOD PANDA.
- Implement Data Validation Layer (Pydantic) for data quality checks.
- Automate daily data ingestion via Cloud Functions.

**Deliverables:**
- Automated data pipelines with validation mechanisms.

=== Sprint 3 (Days 7-10): Backend API, AI Engine, and Monitoring
- Develop REST APIs with FastAPI (Swagger documentation).
- Implement NLP Query Handler and predictive models.
- Integrate Model Monitoring Module for performance tracking.

**Deliverables:**
- Secure APIs, AI models, and monitoring dashboards.

=== Sprint 4 (Days 11-14): Frontend, Feedback, and Deployment
- Build React dashboard with data visualizations.
- Integrate AI Assistant Chat Interface and Feedback Module.
- Deploy MVP on GCP using Cloud Run.

**Deliverables:**
- Fully functional MVP with real-time insights and feedback mechanisms.

== Milestones

1. **Day 3:** Infrastructure ready with monitoring stack on GCP.
2. **Day 6:** Data ingestion pipelines operational with validation layer.
3. **Day 10:** Backend APIs and AI models deployed with performance tracking.
4. **Day 14:** MVP launch with user feedback and behavior tracking.

== Gathering Results

- **User Feedback:** Collected via feedback modules integrated into the dashboard.
- **Model Performance:** Monitored through Prometheus dashboards.
- **User Analytics:** Event tracking to analyze user behavior and feature adoption.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Weekly retraining of models based on feedback and data drift analysis.
